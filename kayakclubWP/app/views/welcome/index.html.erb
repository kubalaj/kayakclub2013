					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Due to its mountainous nature, Colorado is one of North America&#39;s premiere kayaking destinations. CU students of all skill levels can join and be a part of this exciting sport. Beginners can come and learn basic bracing and rolling technique from well-versed instructors while more advanced boaters can come practice their favorite flatwater tricks at our pool sessions. Our trips vary from afternoon hucks down your favorite local creek to multi-day, raft supported expeditions. We can provide all necessary gear for up to 10 people although many people bring their own. At its core, whitewater kayaking is a non-competitive sport, but several of our members are training in slalom and freestyle boating with the hopes of competing at the local and national levels. </p>
